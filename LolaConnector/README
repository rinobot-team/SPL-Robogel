Using LoLA on Nao v6 with CMake

Download the toolchain. ;)
Run path-to-toolchain/yocto-sdk/relocate_qitoolchain.sh
!!! After this the toolchain can't be moved or copied to other devices anymore!

Set the correct path in cross-config.cmake (replace path-to-toolchain with the right folder).

Build the example:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cross-config.cmake
make

Start ./lola_connector on the robot and have fun! :)

Check out lola_connector.cpp to see where you can plug in your walking engine.
